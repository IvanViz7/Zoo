# Towers of Hanoi


## 1. Considerations


#### 1.1 Assumptions
*Zoo is created to help the Zoo owners to administrate it easslier.  *

#### 1.2 Constraints
*The code has not interface, you need a computer MacOS, it does not work for Windows or Ubuntu. You are able to create an habitat with the same name that othe already created, we are working to fix it.*

#### 1.3 System Environment
*It works with MacOS in a Python environment, only download the zoo.exe.*

## 2. Architecture


#### 2.1 Overview
*"The Zoo" is a management application made to help people who are working in a Zoo, it serves to keep track of the animals, describes the animals, you can save the animals in a especific habitat, you can create more habitat, the Zoo app includes a compatibility system that advise you if you are trying to put in two animal not compatible for the same habitat.*

#### 2.2 Component Diagrams
*Provide here the diagram and a detailed description of its most valuable parts. There may be multiple diagrams. Include a description for each diagram. Subsections can be used to list components and their descriptions.*

#### 2.3 Class Diagrams
**

#### 2.4 Sequence Diagrams
*Provide here any sequence diagrams. If possible list the use case they contribute to or solve. Provide descriptions if possible.*

#### 2.5 Deployment Diagrams
*Provide here the deployment diagram for the system including any information needed to describe it. Also, include any information needed to describe future scaling of the system.*

#### 2.6 Other Diagrams
*Provide here any additional diagrams and their descriptions in subsections.*

## 3 User Interface Design
*Provide here any user interface mock-ups or templates. Include explanations to describe the screen flow or progression.*
